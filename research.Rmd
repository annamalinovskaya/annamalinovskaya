## Dissertation Research ##

#### 1. The effect of access to mental healthcare on teen and adolescent pregnancy [JMP] ####

There is a growing literature on the strong association between poor mental health during teenagehood and adolescence and early pregnancy, and although the association established in this literature is not causal, it nevertheless points to the possibility that poor mental health in teens and adolescents, if not addressed through access to appropriate mental healthcare, might lead to early pregnancy through an inconsistent use of contraception, higher levels of sexual activity, or risky sexual behaviors. In this project, I pursue several empirical approaches to analyze the effect of access to mental healthcare under Medicaid on teen and adolescent pregnancy incidence. In particular, in my analysis of adolescent pregnancy, I leverage a discrete break in Medicaid eligibility at age 19 and study the effect of losing access to mental healthcare services provided by Medicaid on adolescent girls’ chances of pregnancy in the short-term. By using detailed data on girls' mental health histories, I distinguish between the effect of losing access to mental healthcare from the effect of losing access to general healthcare and low-cost contraception. In my analysis of teen pregnancy, I use several instruments for the wait time a girl faces for starting mental health treatment under Medicaid and test the hypothesis that longer wait times for starting treatment lead to higher chances of teen pregnancy.  

#### 2. COVID-driven technology adoption and US firm labor demand ####

This project has three objectives. The first objective is to provide more direct evidence than is currently available that technology adoption has a permanent upskilling effect, using granular firm-level data on technology adoption decisions and spending linked to the data on firm-level labor demand, with the identification strategy (instrumental variable) that addresses the endogeneity of firm technology adoption decisions and spending. For this purpose, I link rich Burning Glass Technologies data on millions of firm job postings to restricted firm-level Census Bureau data, and use firms' differential exposure to the COVID pandemic as an instrument for their technology spending. The second objective of this study is to examine in great detail the heterogeneity in the impacts of technology adoption on firm labor demand by type of technology. Understanding this heterogeneity might be crucial to understanding the potential impacts of _new_ technologies on the inequality among workers of different skill levels. Finally, the third objective is to provide first empirical evidence on new job task creation activity by firms. In particular, I use Natural Language Processing methods to identify, quantify, and characterize the distribution of, new job task creation activity by firms for the first time in this literature. 

#### 3. Long-term own and dynamic complementarity effects of the WIC program ####

The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) has been in effect since the 1970s. In this project, I use two identification strategies to estimate the average causal intend-to-treat effects of the WIC program on a range of children’s longer-term outcomes such as educational attainment and economic self-sufficiency in adulthood. The first identification strategy exploits variation across counties and over time from WIC geographical roll-out in the 1970s. For this purpose, I match adult outcomes of individuals in the American Community Survey and Decennial Census 2000 born in the 1970s with their place of birth information in the Social Security Administration's Numident File and then with the historical data on WIC geographical spread across counties. I zoom in on the outcomes of individuals who were most likely eligible for WIC at birth by linking adults in Census 2000 and ACS with their mothers in SIPP. My preliminary findings from the analysis conducted on each of the two samples (ACS and Census) separately are strikingly similar and indicate that exposure to WIC in-utero raises, on average, the probability of graduating from high school and enrolling in college, with the biggest effects for white males. The second identification strategy uses a regression discontinuity design, which I implement by developing county priority rankings for WIC funding in their state mirroring the approach by officials from the state of Texas, who developed such priority rankings for Texas counties in the early 1970s, as indicated by archival records. The use of this second identification strategy enables me to test the assumption common in this literature that the historical roll-out of WIC was exogenous or nearly exogenous. Finally, I study the dynamic complementarity effects of WIC on one hand and Head Start and school quality reforms on the other.
